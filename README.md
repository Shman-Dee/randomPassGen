# 03 Random-Password-Gen

## Description

Here is my next greatest magic trick, a random password generator!! It might seem simple, but the code is more complex than meets the eye. With many itterations, it all came together. Here is a short story of how it all came together.

- First I had a long episode of pseudo coding.

- While most of it seemed great on paper. It wasn't the exact route that I took.

- The pseudo code was writen after I created a rock, paper, scissor game with my tutor (Peter Ting)

- We took the process of writing out each array followed by each possible conditional statment.

- After working with several classmates it seemed I was working uphill.

- It was decided that the conditionals need to be worked in with the variables

- Worked long and hard with my buddy Thom. Thank you Thom!
